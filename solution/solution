The first thing that I implemented in the code was reading the file with a message and implementing an alphabet to have something to order.

I defined a function that needed the encrypted text (that is the message that I had read before in the code) and a number of letters that I want to shift.
I created a loop that would go over every possible char in a message and change it.

In the end I asked the program for an output of every possible shift (as there are 26 possible ones - 26 letters in the alphabet). 
I looked for the one that made the most sense
